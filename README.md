# bigInteger
**Implementation of Custom bigInteger class for large numbers which can perform arithmetic, assignment, and relational operations.**  
  
This project aims to fulfill the size constraints of int data type of C++. Using the bigInteger class, we can create and compute basic mathematical operations on numbers (whose size is limited by the capacity of local machine).  
In this project, the bigInteger class uses string to store the absolute value of any given number.  
The class object can be intitalized from a string value, integer value, or a long int value.  
The operations supported by this implemantation are:-  
&emsp;&emsp;**Arithmatic Operatiors** -> +,-,*,/,%  
&emsp;&emsp;**Assignment Operatiors** -> =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=  
&emsp;&emsp;**Relational Operators** -> ==,!=,>,>=,<,<=
